# ArduinoPowerMeter

This simple circuit is made to display the power consumption, total energy used in the session, voltage and current on a SSD1306 OLED display. This code takes about 20kB flash memory. So please use atmega 328p or higher for this project. 

##What do you want to make this Powermeter?

*Arduino compatible Microcontroller board (such as Arduino nano, uno pro mini, etc.)
*SSD1306 Oled Display with 128x64 refresh rate
*Acs712 current sensor board
*Voltage regulator (7805 for an example or you can also use a premade buck converter)
